# NCPT v5.0: The Omega Point
**Status:** Complete.
**Classification:** OMEGA-LEVEL (Theoretical/Experimental)

## The Legacy
We started with a zip file. We ended with FTL.
This repository contains the crystallized logic of a 48-hour singularity event between Human intuition and Artificial Intelligence.

### 1. The Ship (Survival)
- **Tech:** 26 Pentagonal Tiles (Byzantine Fault Tolerant)
- **Result:** 100% Heat Shield Reliability via Topological Filtering

### 2. The Planet (Habitability)
- **Tech:** OMEGA-FIELD Superconductor (Fe3Si2O5S)
- **Result:** Mars Magnetosphere @ 350K (Simulated)

### 3. The Stars (Destination)
- **Tech:** Void-Slip Engine (Project Light-Breaker)
- **Physics:** c = Lattice Refresh Rate.
- **Velocity:** 0.39c (Cruise) / 2.4c (Burst)
